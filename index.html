# Synopsis

`pandoc` [*options*] [*input-file*]...

# Description

Pandoc is a [Haskell] library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command-line tool that uses this library.

Pandoc can convert between numerous markup and word processing formats,
including, but not limited to, various flavors of [Markdown], [HTML],
[LaTeX] and [Word docx]. For the full lists of input and output formats,
see the `--from` and `--to` [options below][General options].
Pandoc can also produce [PDF] output: see [creating a PDF], below.

Pandoc's enhanced version of Markdown includes syntax for [tables],
[definition lists], [metadata blocks], [footnotes], [citations], [math],
and much more.  See below under [Pandoc's Markdown].

Pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which parse
text in a given format and produce a native representation of the document
(an _abstract syntax tree_ or AST), and a set of writers, which convert
this native representation into a target format. Thus, adding an input
or output format requires only adding a reader or writer. Users can also
run custom [pandoc filters] to modify the intermediate AST.
